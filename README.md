# BBC News Labs Bootstrap Theme

This is a BBC News Labs theme for Bootstrap, loosely based on the style of the beta version of the new BBC News responsive site.

e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014

This gives us a single theme to use across BBC News Labs experiments to quickly build prototypes with a unifed apperance, while being able to take advantage of the vast number of Bootstrap plugins and compatible extensions.

This theme was created with Themestrap, see themestrap-README.md for details.
